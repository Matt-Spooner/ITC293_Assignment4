                            The Albury Museum of Scintillating Objects required a way to reduce their skyrocketing energy costs.
                            I worked with the business to design and install at 60 panel rooftop solar and battery system.
                            The unique design was conceived to suit the aesthetic characteristics of the existing building, whilst delivering maximum efficiency and power output.
                            This project is an example of the many challenging design problems often faced by the solar industry, and how they can be overcome with innovative design solutions.

                            Wagga Wagga Agriculture Company manages 200 properties around the region.
                            They required a portable off grid solar system that could be used at various sites.
                            I worked with the business to develop a portable system that can be deployed from a shipping container and easily transported when required.
                            After prototyping and testing the system, the business purchased six units which have been put to constant use since they were delivered.
                            The business estimates they have saved over $60,000 in costs they would have otherwise spent using petrol powered generators.
