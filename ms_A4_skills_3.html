                    <p>Solar energy is a cost-effective method to generate electricity for homes and businesses, however the process of choosing the right solar system is one that requires much consideration.</p>
                    <p>The business must endeavour to understand the client’s needs through meetings and discussions, from which they may collaborate with staff, external organisations, and stakeholders, to develop a solution that is tailored for the project. For such a process to succeed, communication skills are essential.</p>
                    <p>"Effective business communication is essential to success in today's work environments." Chan, p. 3, this is why communication skills are vital for professionals working within the solar industry.</p>
                    <p>I have extensive experience designing, developing and installing solar power systems for residential and commercial clients, through which I have employed exemplary communication skills to deliver quality products that exceed expectations.</p>
